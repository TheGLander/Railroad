      <b>R</b>ail<b>R</b>oad is a <b>R</b>oute <b>R</b>epository for routes
      meant for the Steam/CC2 ruleset. This is the CC2 version of the
      <a href="https://davidstolp.com/old/chips/tws">public TWS</a>, which is a
      repository for MS and Lynx routes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prime way of interacting with Railroad is with
      <a href="https://glander.club/notcc">NotCC</a>, which will have native
      support for Railroad in the near future.
    </p>
    <h2>Categories</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike the public TWS, Railroad keeps all previously-uploaded routes for a
      level and allows tagging routes as mainline or as a non-mainline
      miscellaneous category. A route can be considered mainline if it's:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>scoreboard-legal</li>
      <li>can be reasonably performed by a human</li>
      <li>is optimized</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Non-mainline routes are routes which still have some use for the average
      person, but can't be considered mainline. Examples include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Routes which use glitches which aren't scoreboard-legal. Eg. CC2LP1 #149
        Bye Bye Bye - "Simultaneous character movement glitch"
      </li>
      <li>
        Routes which aren't optimal but easier to execute. Eg. CC2 #200 CRAZY II
        - "No 3-hour wait"
      </li>
      <li>
        Routes which show alternative or no-bust solutions. Eg. CC2 #112 Bowl to
        Freedom - "No bust"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Username</h2>
    <p class="loggedOutOnly">
      To submit a route, you need to pick a username. Username:
      <input id="userNameInput" /><button id="submitUsernameButton">Ok</button
      ><br />
      Press <button id="useAuthTokenButton">Use Auth Token</button> if you have
      one.
    </p>
    <p class="loggedInOnly">
      You are logged in as <b id="usernameText"></b>. If you want to use this
      username on another device,
      <button id="copyAuthTokenButton">Copy your Auth Token</button> and input
      it on the new device.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are having any troubles with the username system or want to change
      or delete your username, ask about it in the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/Xd4dUY9"
        >Chip's Challenge Bit Busters Club Discord Server</a
      >
    </p>
    <h2>Upload</h2>
    <p class="loggedOutOnly">Pick a username to upload routes.</p>
    <p class="loggedInOnly">
      Upload <span id="moreRoutesText">more </span>route files by dragging them
      onto the website or by clicking
